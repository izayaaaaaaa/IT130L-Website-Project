                In September 2020, Eden Pearl T. San Antonio cut the ribbon of Mommy Puring Variety Store, a humble store located at the heart of the public market of Quezon, Nueva Ecija. Initially, she looked forward to establishing a grocery store that would sell goods
                that cater to the essential commodities of the townsfolk. However, as someone who passionately earned a degree in Marketing, she desired to use her learnings for vending products that would be both unique and can earn customers' hearts.

            <p class="about-p2">
                Following this premise, she decided to market Korean treats and goodies. The business started with an initial capital of PHP 10,000.00, exclusively worth of Korean goods and treats. A year after, the business flourished and became able to sell bulk amounts
                of Korean treats and goodies. At present, the business continues to offer Korean treats and goodies.

            <p class="about-p1">
                Hi! I am Eden Pearl T. San Antonio, 29, the owner of Mommy Puring Variety Store. 
                Back on 2020, when I was 28, I established the said store. I am a marketing graduate so promoting my 
                products to friends, loved ones, and customers is among the things I enjoy doing. 
            </p>

            <p class="about-p1">
                Since my childhood days, I was acquainted with business. I do different kinds of selling, from selling 
                chocolates to my elementary classmates, halo-halo on summer, and beauty products during my college years. 
                Before bringing Mommy Puring Variety Store to life, I initially worked as a sales marketing agent. 
                From the word “sale”, yes, I do online selling. From there, I developed my skills in promoting business products and services. 
                While working, I attempted to enter a business. I did business ventures with partnerships yet have not earned success. Maybe, 
                I am not meant for the partnership kind of business. 
            </p>

            <p class="about-p1">
                As the COVID-19 Pandemic struck, I observed that many of my friends are starting their own businesses. This inspired me to start my 
                own business venture, Mommy Puring Variety Store. 
            </p>

            <p class="about-p1">
                “Money is not really the key in starting a business, it’s perseverance and courage. Nothing will happen if I won’t move. I was very hands-on with 
                Mommy Puring Variety store from the moment I opened its doors up to the moment.”
                “I started buying my products by piece, now I am buying them by box. Hopefully, in God’s perfect timing, I will be buying them by truck loads”
