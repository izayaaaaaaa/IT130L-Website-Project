                        In September 2020, Eden Pearl T. San Antonio cut the ribbon of Mommy Puring Variety Store, a humble store located at the heart of the public market of Quezon, Nueva Ecija. Initially, she looked forward to establishing a grocery store that would sell goods
                        that cater to the essential commodities of the townsfolk. However, as someone who passionately earned a degree in Marketing, she desired to use her learnings for vending products

                        that would be both unique and can earn customers' hearts. Following this premise, she decided to market Korean treats and goodies. The business started with an initial capital of PHP 10,000.00, exclusively worth of Korean goods and treats. A year after,
                        the business flourished and became able to sell bulk amounts of Korean treats and goodies. At present, the business continues to offer Korean treats and goodies.

                        Hi! I am Eden Pearl T. San Antonio, 29, the owner of Mommy Puring Variety Store. Back on 2020, when I was 28, I established the said store. I am a marketing graduate so promoting my products to friends, loved ones, and customers is among the things I
                        enjoy doing.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-p1">
                        Since my childhood days, I was acquainted with business. I do different kinds of selling, from selling chocolates to my elementary classmates, halo-halo on summer, and beauty products during my college years. Before bringing Mommy Puring Variety Store
                        to life, I initially worked as a sales marketing agent. From the word “sale”, yes, I do online selling. From there, I developed my skills in promoting business products and services. While working, I attempted to enter a business.
                        I did business ventures with partnerships yet have not earned success. Maybe, I am not meant for the partnership kind of business.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-p1">
                        As the COVID-19 Pandemic struck, I observed that many of my friends are starting their own businesses. This inspired me to start my own business venture, Mommy Puring Variety Store.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-p1">
                        “Money is not really the key in starting a business, it’s perseverance and courage. Nothing will happen if I won’t move. I was very hands-on with Mommy Puring Variety store from the moment I opened its doors up to the moment.” “I started buying my products
                        by piece, now I am buying them by box. Hopefully, in God’s perfect timing, I will be buying them by truck loads”
